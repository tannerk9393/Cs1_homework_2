// Exercise: The 2s-complement for 8-bit integers

Step 1: Start with an 8-bit number
Step 2: Look at left-most bit, if it is a '1', the number is negative
Step 2: If the number is negative, take all of the bits as an separate input
Step 3: Run each digit input into a separate NOT gate to take 1's complement
Step 4: From each NOT gate, run to separate output bit
Step 5: Use these outputs as new input digits
Step 6: With these new inputs, use Full Adders to add 1 to your 1's complement number
Step 7: Add 1 to right most bit with intial carry bit of 0
Step 8: If 1 + right bit = 2, carry bit = 1 and sum bit = 1
Step 9: Otherwise carry bit = 0 and sum bit = 1
Step 10: Continue adding using normal arithmetic from right to left until you reach end of inputs
Step 11: Ignore 9th bit if there is one
Step 11: Final output is the 2's complement

integer array(8) X
integer i
integer addOne
integer carrybit
integer temp

// for first full carry adder
carrybit = 0
//for making two's complement
addOne = 1 

function Fulladder(arrayBit, addOne, carrybit) returns newBit
   temp = arrayBit + addOne + carrybit
   if temp = 2
      carrybit = 1
      addOne = 0
      newBit = 0
    //2 = 10 in binary corresponding to setting carrybit|newBit to 1 and 0
   else
      carrybit = 0
      addOne = 0
      newBit = 1
//addOne set to 0 because it's essentially adding 00000001
//now can just worry about adding the carrybit to the arrayBit

//Setting 8bit integer
for i = 0; i < 8; i= i + 1
   X[i] = Get next input
   
//one's complement only if it's a negative sign bit
if X[0] == 1
   NOT X[0] through X[7]
else 
   Put X[0] through X[7] to output 
//Positive number, no need to take 1 or 2's complement   
//Need some kind of halt here if else block is executed
 
//Adding 1 to one's complement to make two's complement
function Main()
    for i = 7 ; i > -1; i = i - 1
        X[i] = Fulladder(X[i], addOne, carrybit)

//Printing two's complement from array
for i = 0; i < 8; i = i -1 //moving leftward through array
   Put X[i] to output
